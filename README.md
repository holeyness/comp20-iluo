Web Programming

Tufts University

Purpose: The purpose of this repository is to showcase the student projects for the class Comp 20 (Web Programming) for future reference purposes.

My favorite project through the semester was project 4, creating a gamecenter for 2048. The premise was to use server-side technology to create a game center where names and scores for the popular game 2048 would be stored. I think this is a really interesting idea because it would be a useful project in the outside world, and it ties together everything that we've learned thus far in the semester in terms of working with both the client-side and the server side. This project required the use of Node.js with Express and Jade. Although it took a significant amount of time, much longer than the other ones, the server application was quite useful once correctly coded and deployed.

I am proud of my MBTA Map where we implemented a Google Maps interface that displayed all the T station and based on your geolocation, the closest station, and a schedule of trains at every stop. The reason is after nearly a week of struggling to debug the program, I finally discovered I had an issue with the scoping of an iterator variable. I was ecstatic once I finally got the program working.

Throughout this course, I have learned the basics of the Web (from HTML and basic networking) to advanced web programming topics like server and client side programming using Javascript. I have learned a lot of practical skills that can be applied to many future projects and learned a lot from Ming.
